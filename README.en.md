# DeepSeek GUI

[简体中文](./README.md) | English

> Bring the local DeepSeek TUI agent into a desktop workbench: **Code** for development, **Write** for documents, **Claw** for IM automation—chat, change review, Skill/MCP management, and updates in one graphical app.

DeepSeek GUI is a local desktop workbench for developers and frequent AI users. It builds on [DeepSeek TUI](https://github.com/Hmbown/DeepSeek-TUI) and turns the terminal agent experience into an easier, longer-lived app: choose a workspace, start a task, watch reasoning and tool calls stream in, review file changes, and approve sensitive actions when needed.

The goal is not to ship another chat wrapper. The goal is to make DeepSeek feel like a reliable desktop partner for real project work.

---

## What We Built

- A desktop app around the DeepSeek TUI local runtime, with default runtime auto-start and management.
- A full chat workbench with multiple sessions, streaming output, history, interruption, and resend flows.
- Local workspace integration so the agent can read, edit, and create files in real projects.
- Change review surfaces that make every file modification visible and inspectable.
- First-run onboarding, settings, language/theme/font controls, notifications, local logs, and update entry points.
- Graphical Skill and MCP management so users can extend the agent without hand-editing every config file.
- Claw background automation with Feishu / Lark integration, dedicated IM agents, local webhook / relay support, and scheduled tasks.
- A dedicated Write workbench with writing spaces, a Markdown file tree, live editing/preview, inline completion, and selection-based inline agent actions.
- Pre-built macOS and Windows installers; Linux/Unix users can build from source.

## Highlights

- **Desktop chat workbench**: multi-session chat with streamed replies, reasoning, tool calls, approval requests, and file changes in one place.
- **Project workspaces**: choose a local directory for each task, organize sessions by workspace, preview files, open files in your editor, and pick Git branches.
- **Change review**: inline diffs and a side review panel help you understand exactly what the agent changed.
- **Controlled permissions**: choose read-only, workspace-write, full-access, or external sandbox modes, and decide when tool calls require approval.
- **Managed runtime**: use the bundled DeepSeek TUI by default, or point the app at your own `deepseek` executable.
- **Skill and MCP support**: create Skills, edit MCP config, add common tools, and open the related folders from the UI.
- **Claw background automation**: run a background agent alongside normal chat, with current support for Feishu / Lark, IM webhook / relay flows, and scheduled tasks.
- **Write mode**: manage `~/.deepseekgui/write_workspace` and custom writing spaces, browse Markdown files, use live Markdown editing, preview relative images, get DeepSeek FIM short completion / inspiration completion with optional cross-document BM25 + keyword retrieval, export the current document as `HTML / PDF / DOC / DOCX`, and invoke the writing assistant directly from selected text.
- **Friendly first launch**: choose language, add your DeepSeek API key, and optionally set a compatible Base URL.
- **Local-first**: preferences, sessions, logs, and runtime config stay on your machine; model calls use your own DeepSeek API key.
- **English and Chinese UI**: switch languages from Settings at any time.
- **Cross-platform use**: macOS `.dmg/.zip` and Windows `.exe`; Linux/Unix users can build from source.

## Who It Is For

- Developers who want DeepSeek to work on real codebases without living in a terminal.
- Teams that need to see what the agent did, which files changed, and which operations required approval.
- Users who maintain multiple projects or long-running conversations and want reusable Skill/MCP setup.
- Anyone who wants a local desktop workbench connected to the official DeepSeek API or a compatible endpoint.

## Three Workbench Modes

DeepSeek GUI exposes three modes in the top-left sidebar: **Code**, **Write**, and **Claw**. They share the same DeepSeek runtime and settings, but keep sessions, workspaces, and layouts separate so you can switch by task.

### Code Mode

The development workbench for real codebases: bind a local project directory, read and edit files, run commands, and review changes.

<p align="center">
  <img src="src/asset/img/codemode.png" alt="DeepSeek GUI Code mode" width="860">
</p>

- Organize multiple agent sessions by workspace, with streamed reasoning, tool calls, and file changes in one view.
- Inline diffs, a change-review panel, and permission modes from read-only to full access.
- Quick-start cards for common tasks such as project mapping, bug fixing, implementation planning, and UI polish.

### Write Mode

A dedicated Markdown writing workbench that keeps writing files, save state, and AI assistance separate from Code sessions.

<p align="center">
  <img src="src/asset/img/writemode.png" alt="DeepSeek GUI Write mode" width="860">
</p>

- Manage `~/.deepseekgui/write_workspace` plus custom writing spaces from the left file tree.
- Switch between **Live / Source / Split / Preview**; Live keeps Markdown source on the active line and renders the rest.
- Export the current Markdown document from the toolbar as `HTML / PDF / DOC / DOCX`, with best-effort preservation for headings, lists, code blocks, tables, and local images.
- DeepSeek FIM short and inspiration completion, plus selection-based inline agent actions and a right-side writing assistant for summaries, outlines, and polish.

### Claw Mode

Background automation and IM integration, so agents can keep handling messages and scheduled jobs outside normal chat.

<p align="center">
  <img src="src/asset/img/clawmode.png" alt="DeepSeek GUI Claw mode" width="860">
</p>

- Configure dedicated agents for Feishu / Lark and other channels, each with its own profile, default model, and workspace.
- Every IM agent gets its own thread, so you can debug replies and tool calls directly in the GUI.
- Local webhook / relay support and scheduled tasks for team workflows and automation.

## Install

### Download a Pre-built Package

Download the latest build from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/XingYu-Zhong/DeepSeek-GUI/releases):

| Platform | Package |
| --- | --- |
| macOS | `.dmg` or `.zip`, Intel and Apple Silicon |
| Windows | `.exe`, NSIS installer, x64 |

Linux/Unix pre-built downloads are currently not published. Linux users can build from source; because the built-in terminal depends on the native `node-pty` module, build Linux packages on Linux instead of cross-packaging them from macOS or Windows.

On first launch, enter your [DeepSeek API key](https://platform.deepseek.com/api_keys). If you use a DeepSeek/OpenAI-compatible endpoint, you can set a custom Base URL in Settings.

### Run from Source

For contributors and local development:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/XingYu-Zhong/DeepSeek-GUI.git
cd DeepSeek-GUI
npm install
npm run dev
```

Requirements:

- Node.js 20+
- A DeepSeek API key
- Internet access during the first dependency install

For slower network access in mainland China, use an npm mirror:

```bash
npm install --registry=https://registry.npmmirror.com
```

---

## First Run

1. Open DeepSeek GUI.
2. Choose your interface language in the onboarding guide.
3. Enter your DeepSeek API key; set a custom Base URL if needed.
4. Choose a default workspace, or use the default directory created by the app.
5. Start a new session and describe the task you want the agent to handle.

Typical flow (**Code mode**):

- Pick or switch a workspace from the sidebar.
- Describe the task in the composer.
- Watch reasoning, tool calls, command execution, and file changes as they happen.
- Allow or deny actions that require approval.
- Inspect changes in the review panel before deciding what to do next.

See [Three Workbench Modes](#three-workbench-modes) above for Claw and Write details. Quick start:

- **Claw**: enable background automation in Settings → add a Feishu / Lark connection → configure agent profile, model, and workspace → optionally enable webhook / relay or scheduled tasks.
- **Write**: switch to Write mode → use the default writing space or add a new one → write in the Live editor with completion, selection inline agent, and the right-side writing assistant.

## Usage and Settings

Settings manages:

- DeepSeek API key, Base URL, runtime port, and runtime token.
- Auto-start for the local runtime, plus optional custom `deepseek` path.
- Tool approval policy and filesystem access mode.
- Default workspace, language, theme, font size, and completion notifications.
- GUI updates, DeepSeek TUI updates, and local error logs.
- Skill creation, Skill folders, and MCP config editing.
- Claw background automation, Feishu / Lark connections, webhook / relay settings, and scheduled tasks.

Keyboard shortcuts:

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `Enter` | Send message |
| `Shift+Enter` | Newline in composer |
| `Ctrl+Enter` | Send message |
| `Esc` | Close a panel or dismiss the current overlay |

## Write Mode Design Notes

Write mode extends DeepSeek GUI from a code/chat workbench into a long-form writing workspace. Its implementation borrows several ideas from the local `textide` and `openhanako` reference projects:

- Workspaces and file tree: textide inspired the writing-space model, keeping writing files, active file state, save status, and AI context separate from code sessions.
- Markdown live editing: openhanako inspired the CodeMirror decorations approach where the active line stays editable as Markdown source while inactive lines render headings, tasks, images, dividers, and tables through widgets.
- Selection inline agent: openhanako inspired the selection-capture and floating-input interaction, so selected text can be sent with file path, line numbers, and bounded original text as structured context.
- AI session isolation: Write still reuses normal DeepSeek TUI agent threads, but the GUI keeps a local write thread registry per writing space so write conversations do not pollute code/claw sidebars.
- Text completion: writing completion bypasses the local TUI serve runtime and calls the DeepSeek FIM Completion API directly for low-latency ghost text. Short completion uses a short debounce, small token budget, and strict local filtering; inspiration completion uses a longer pause, larger token budget, and only runs at line ends or paragraph boundaries. Before completion, the app builds a short-TTL lightweight index over Markdown / text files in the writing space, retrieves cross-document snippets with BM25 + keyword matching, and injects them as a hidden Markdown comment so terminology, facts, and style stay consistent.

## Uninstall

### Windows

- Open Settings -> Apps -> Installed apps, find `DeepSeek GUI`, and uninstall it.
- Or uninstall from Control Panel -> Programs and Features.
- Or run the uninstaller from the installation directory.

The Windows installer creates Start Menu and desktop shortcuts by default. It does not force a taskbar pin; pin it manually from the Start Menu if you want one.

### macOS

- Move `DeepSeek GUI.app` from Applications to Trash.
- If macOS blocks the app on first open, right-click it in Finder and choose Open.
- For local unsigned builds, you can remove the quarantine attribute first:

```bash
npm run mac:unquarantine -- '/Applications/DeepSeek GUI.app'
```

### Linux

- If you built a Linux package from source, delete the related `.AppImage` or installed files.
- If you manually created a desktop entry or shortcut, delete that too.

### Remove Local Data

By default, uninstalling removes the app but keeps local settings, sessions, and runtime config so reinstalling is smoother. For a full cleanup, remove these paths if needed:

| Platform | App data path |
| --- | --- |
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/DeepSeek GUI` |
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\DeepSeek GUI` |
| Linux | `~/.config/DeepSeek GUI` |

DeepSeek TUI shared config usually lives in `~/.deepseek`. Check it before deleting, because it may contain API key, MCP, or Skill settings you still need.

---

## Updates

- For regular users: macOS/Windows can check GUI updates in Settings or download the latest installer from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/XingYu-Zhong/DeepSeek-GUI/releases); Linux/Unix users should build from source.
- For the DeepSeek TUI runtime: when the GUI manages the runtime, Settings can check and upgrade the bundled TUI.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome for bug fixes, UI/UX improvements, documentation, localization, build/release workflows, and runtime integration.

Project conventions:

- The current default collaboration branch is `develop`.
- Start features and fixes from the latest `develop`, preferably on a short-lived feature branch.
- Open pull requests into `develop` by default; maintainers merge reviewed changes into `master`.
- Align on scope first for larger or riskier changes.
- Run `npm run typecheck`, `npm run build`, and `npm run test` before opening a PR.
- Include a video or GIF when the UI changes.
- Include unit tests when project logic changes.
- Update both `README.md` and `README.en.md` when usage changes.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./docs/CONTRIBUTING.md) and [DEVELOPMENT.md](./docs/DEVELOPMENT.md) for details.

## Local Build

```bash
npm run build           # production build
npm run dist:mac        # macOS packages
npm run dist:win        # Windows installer
npm run dist:linux      # Linux AppImage; run this on Linux
```

Linux/Unix pre-built downloads are not published for now. If you need a Linux build, install dependencies and run `npm run dist:linux` in the target Linux environment; the built-in terminal depends on `node-pty`, and cross-packaging can make terminal startup fail.

For the full development workflow, see [DEVELOPMENT.md](./docs/DEVELOPMENT.md).
